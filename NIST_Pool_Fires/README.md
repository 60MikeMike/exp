## NIST Pool Fires

This directory contains experiments measurements of liquid pool fires. Two circular pool diameters are reported, 30 cm and 100 cm. 

The 30 cm burner is 15 cm deep and has a wall thickness of 1.6 mm. The burner was fitted with legs such that the burner rim was positioned 0.3 m above the floor. The bottom of the burner was maintained at a constant temperature by flowing tap water (nominally 20 Â°C) through a 3 cm section on the bottom of the fuel pan.

Notes

* Weckman and Strong (1996) report a burner diameter of 30.5 cm. The burner used at NIST has a diameter of 30.1 cm.

* The lip height reported by Weckman and Strong (1996) and Kim et al. (2019) is 10 mm. Hamins et al. (1993), Klassen et al. (1994), and Hamins and Lock (2016) report a lip height of 5 mm.

* The reported radiative fraction in the reported studies varied between 0.18 and 0.22.

* The amount of CO in the exhaust stream was below detection limits; thus, the combustion efficiency for methanol is assumed to be 1. The efficiency for the other fuels is not reported.


### Temperature

Hamins and Lock (2016) made mean and rms centerline and radial gas temperature measurements for a 30 cm methanol pool fire. The radial measurements were made at heights of 3, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm.

Sung et al. (2019) made mean and rms centerline and radial gas temperature measurements for a 100 cm methanol pool fire. The radial measurements were made at heights of 20, 60, 100, 140, and 180 cm.

### Gas Species Concentrations

Falkenstein-Smith et al. (2019) measured the time-averaged centerline species concentrations within the flaming region of three 30 cm liquid fuel fires: acetone, ethanol, and methanol. The measurements were made using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer system (GC/MSD). The volume fraction of each species was calculated via the number of moles identified by the GC/MSD at each centerline point. Soot mass fractions were measured during the gas sampling process. The data is in the files `Acetone_30_cm.csv`, `Ethanol_30_cm.csv`, and `Methanol_30_cm.csv`.


### Heat Flux

Radiative and total heat flux measurements were made at various locations for the 30~cm methanol pool fire. 

	Radial profiles of temperature at various heights in the fire [2,6]

	Radial profile of radiative heat flux [3] and total [2] heat flux onto the pool surface

	Radial profile of radiative heat flux in the downward direction beyond the pool radius [2, 4]

	Vertical profiles of radiative heat flux in the horizontal direction 60 cm and 82.5 cm from the pool center [2,4 ]
