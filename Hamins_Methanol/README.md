The files in this directory contain measurement data for a 30.5 cm diameter methanol pool fire. The experimental configuration was similar to the Waterloo Methanol experiments performed by Beth Weckman. The data includes:

   * Centerline temperature and gas species concentrations extending from the pool surface to approximately 60 cm above the pool
   * Radial profiles of temperature at heights of 3 cm, 30 cm, and 60 cm above the surface
   * Radial profile of heat flux at the pool surface extending beyond the pool itself to approximately 80 cm
