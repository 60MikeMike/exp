# NIST/NRC Corner and Wall Effects Experiments
The data sets on this page are from large compartment experiments where a natural gas burner was positioned (1) in a corner and (2) against a wall, and then moved outward in stages until the corner or wall effect became negligible.

The compartment was 11 m long, 7 m wide, and 3.8 m high. The burner was 60 cm by 60 cm and the burner surface was 54 cm above the floor. The long dimension of the compartment ran east-west. A 1.8 m wide, 2.4 m high door was centered on the east (short) wall. The corner fire was located in the southwest corner. The wall fire was centered on the south (long) wall.

The experiments began with the burner in the corner or against the wall for the first 30 min. At 30 min, the burner was moved so that its edge(s) was 10 cm away from the wall(s). It remained for 15 min, after which it was moved to 20 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 160 cm, each time remaining 15 min for a total experiment time of 2 h.

A three-dimensional array of thermocouples was positioned on a track mounted to the ceiling above the burner. The purpose of this array was to measure maximum plume temperatures at heights of 2.1 m, 2.7 m, and 3.4 m above the floor. As the burner moved, the thermocouple array moved with it. For the corner fire experiments, when the burner was at the 0 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm positions, the thermocouple array overhead remained at its original location in the corner. As the burner moved beyond 20 cm, the thermocouple array was moved the same amount so that the burner was always below the array in the same position. In other words, for the corner fire experiments, after the center point of the burner reached the point directly below the position 18 on the diagram below, the burner and array moved together, maintaining their relative position.

The data files in this folder contain primarily thermocouple measurements. The key to the column names are as follows:

TC-AG-01 through TC-AG-29 are the thermocouples at the top of the cage, 46 cm below the ceiling (see pattern below).

TC-BG-01 through TC-BG-29 are the thermocouples at the mid-level of the cage, 107 cm below the ceiling (see pattern below).

TC-CG-01 through TC-CG-29 are the thermocouples at the bottom of the cage, 168 cm below the ceiling (see pattern below).

TC-WT-01 through TC-WT-13 are the thermocouples of the vertical array called the West Tree. The array was 2.75 m from the west (short) wall and 3.5 m from the south (long) wall. TC-WT-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.

TC-ET-01 through TC-ET-13 are the thermocouples of the East Tree. The array was 2.75 m from the east (short) wall and 3.5 m from the south (long) wall. TC-ET-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.

TC-C-01 through TC-C-11 are the thermocouples 2 cm from the corner above the corner fire. TC-C-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.

TC-W-01 through TC-W-11 are the thermocouples 2 cm from the wall above the wall fire. TC-W-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.

HRR (cal) is the heat release rate of the fire as measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry. HRR (NG) is the heat release rate determined from the mass flow rate of natural gas.
