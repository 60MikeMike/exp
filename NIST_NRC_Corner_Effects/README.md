# NIST/NRC Corner Effects
The data sets on this page are from large compartment experiments where a natural gas burner was positioned in a corner and against a wall, and then moved outward progressively until the corner and wall effects became negligible.

The compartment is 11 m long, 7 m wide, and 3.8 m high. The burner is 60 cm by 60 cm and the burner surface is 50 cm above the floor. The long dimension runs east-west. A 1.8 m wide, 2.4 m high door is centered on the east (short) wall. The corner fire is in the southwest corner. The wall fire is centered on the south (long) wall.

The experiments began with the burner in the corner or against the wall for the first 30 min. At 30 min, the burner was moved so that its edge(s) was 10 cm away from the wall. It remained for 15 min, after which it moved to 20 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 160 cm, each time remaining 15 min for a total experiment time of 2 h.

A three-dimensional array of thermocouples was positioned on a track mounted to the ceiling above the burner. The purpose of this array was to measure maximum plume temperatures at heights of 2.1 m, 2.7 m, and 3.4 m above the floor. As the burner moved, the thermocouple array moved with it. When the burner was at the 0 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm positions, the thermocouple array overhead remained at its original location in the corner or against the wall. As the burner moved beyond 20 cm, the thermocouple array was moved the same amount so that the burner was always below the array.

The data sets contain primarily thermocouple measurements. The key to the column names are as follows:

TC-AG-01 through TC-AG-29 are the thermocouples at the top of the cage, 46 cm below the ceiling.

TC-BG-01 through TC-BG-29 are the thermocouples at the mid-level of the cage, 107 cm below the ceiling.

TC-CG-01 through TC-CG-29 are the thermocouples at the bottom of the cage, 168 cm below the ceiling.

TC-WT-01 through TC-WT-13 are the thermocouples of the West Tree, closest the fire. It is 2.75 m from the west (short) wall and 3.5 m from the south (long) wall. TC-WT-01 is 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest are spaced 30 cm apart.

TC-ET-01 through TC-ET-13 are the thermocouples of the East Tree, farthest from the fire. It is 2.75 m from the east (short) wall and 3.5 m from the south (long) wall. TC-ET-01 is 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest are spaced 30 cm apart.

TC-C-01 through TC-C-11 are the thermouples in the corner above the corner fire. TC-C-01 is 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest are spaced 30 cm apart.

TC-W-01 through TC-W-11 are the thermouples in along the wall above the wall fire. TC-W-01 is 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest are spaced 30 cm apart.

HRR (cal) is the heat release rate of the fire as measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry. HRR (NG) is the heat release rate determined from the mass flow rate of natural gas.
